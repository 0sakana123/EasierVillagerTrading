Mod description
===============

This mod speeds up trading with villagers a lot, by changing the meaning of the buttons in the trade selection GUI:

- Clicking a trade will execute this trade once (instead of just preparing it)
- Shift-clicking a trade will execute it as often as possible (until either the villager locks the trade or you run out of trading materials)
- Ctrl-clicking the trade will prepare, but not execute it (the default behaviour of the selection buttons)
- In config file, add servers to whitelist with comma-separated.

The mod generally works with servers as well. If it doesn't with yours, your server owner may have some AntiCheat plugin enabled. Use at your own risk.

For the above reasons, please add the server address you wish to enable to your config when using it in SMP. Multiple addresses can be separated by commas.

To make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft, 
it has been optimized using
